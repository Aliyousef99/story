                <b>Carl:</b> It needs to be profound, something that touches souls.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> It needs to be a big “fuck you” Carl. It also needs to make money.<br>

                <b>Donald:</b> My obsession is not with fucking my friend, only with the idea of fuc-<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> Oh please don’t start with your speech Donnie<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> What speech is that?<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> The whole world revolves around a bunch of people trying to fuck one another and blah blah and we need to say a fuck you and blah blah and the word “fuck” in what seems like meaningful statements but are actually a load of bullshit.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> Is there liquor in that cigarette of yours?<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> I heard you the first time.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> Well if you had let me go on with my speech you would maybe do more than just hear me and actually listen.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> It won’t make money, because you want it to make money. Your need for monetary gain will result in it not making us anything.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> Well there’s definitely pot in that smoke of yours.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> It’s called perspective, Donald. Maybe we need some of that.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> We have perspective you idiot, what we need is a way to monetize that perspective.

                <b>Donald:</b> What do you care about, huh?<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> I care about being heard, being remembered, and taught around the globe.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> Yeah, and you’d rather continue sleeping in my office for that, than actually make some money?<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> I’ll be like Weber, and Ishiguro Donnie.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> Who in the fuck is that?<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> If it’s such a big deal, I can find someplace else to stay, Donnie.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> No, no you can’t. Do you know why? Because you don’t have any money, you hypocrite.
                <b>Carl:</b> There was no contradiction in the things I said.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> You tell me that money is not a proper goal, yet your goal is to have your name remembered via Alfred fucking Nobel?<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> How so?<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> I have no intention of being a struggling artist that is remembered only after he dies.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> I have no intention of ruining this.<br>

                <b>Donald:</b> Just because you like it in its original, raw form doesn’t mean everyone else does. Some people actually prefer it in a more easily digestible form. But no wonder you don’t know that, you hardly ever leave this place.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> What does me not leaving have anything to do with our conversation?<br>
