                <b>Donald:</b> Oh right, so you finally came around to that.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> I was always around, Donnie.<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> I don’t know.<br>

                <b>Donald:</b> So, what about that movie?<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> Sure, go ahead.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> I thought you wanted people to experience it raw. What changed your mind?<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> It matters to me.<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> Yes, and that, <i>that</i> is the problem. I wante-<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> To create a ‘simulsacra’.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> A simulacra, yes.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> How’d that turn out for you?<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> Worse than it did for you.<br>

                <b>Carl:</b> Even if you started it?<br>

                <b>Donald:</b> Ten, actually. It was quite difficult, but it worked.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> I’m proud of you.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> You didn’t create a simuwhatever.<br>

                <b>Donald:</b> You just opened a door, that’s all you did. You may have thought you were replacing reality, but you didn’t replace shit. 
                You just let in the people that would. I was at least smart enough to set up a ticket booth at that door.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> Can you raise the prices?<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> I think you should be proud of yourself.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> According to you, I caused all this bullshit.<br>

                <b>Donald:</b> You did do better. Better than all of them. Hell, you are the new Alfred Nobel.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> I didn’t kill anyone.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> Neither did he. He just opened the door to people blowing each other to pieces. Hell, if anything, he’s probably a good part of why we don’t want to blow each other up anymore because of the whole peace prize.<br>
                <b>Carl:</b> We don’t want to do that?<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> You, my friend, deserve his name next to yours more than anyone else.<br>
                <b>Donald:</b> You showed everyone that it didn’t matter who or what was telling the story. Your masterpiece—it’s a new type of dynamite.<br>
